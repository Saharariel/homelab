# üè† Homelab Infrastructure

This repository contains the GitOps-managed configuration for my home Kubernetes cluster using FluxCD, K3s, and various self-hosted services.

## Overview

This repository follows a GitOps approach to manage and automate the infrastructure and services running in my homelab. All Kubernetes manifests and Helm releases are stored and version-controlled here, making it easy to replicate, recover, and scale the setup.

Originally, I ran everything with Docker and Docker Compose. But as my setup grew in complexity, I decided to migrate to Kubernetes.

Admittedly, this is overkill for a homelab - but that's kind of the point. This project is my playground for learning Kubernetes through hands-on experience, while also powering the self-hosted services I use every day.
